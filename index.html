				<p>I'm a Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. In my spare time, I like to read and eat delicious meals - not that I have much spare time, since school keeps me eternally busy.</p>
				<p>"What's that?" you ask, "There's no way you could be that occupied." Oh yes, there is a way, and it unfortunately seems to be the way I'm headed. School is the reason why I'm <span class="mobileOnly">unable to keep in touch with friends and do things fun, exciting things like scuba diving&mdash;or so I tell myself.</span></p>

				<p>I don't want to ramble on for too long, so scroll down to find some things that I like in a nice visual format (i.e. reading is optional). On the other hand, if you <em>want</em> to hear me ramble (thank you!), head on over to my blog, where I talk about anything and everything.</p>

					<h3>Still Life</h3>
					<p><em>Dawn Golden</em></p>
					<p>When I found out about <em>Still Life</em> shortly after it came out, I listened to it on repeat for about a week. I still listen to it on repeat sometimes. Sometimes the lyrics can be contrived, but it works as a whole. There's also a remix album if you want more bass and have a sad party with friends (or on your own).</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>Lighght</h3>
					<p><em>Kishi Bashi</em></p>
					<p>This is one of the most magical albums you will ever hear. K writes about everlasting love in fairytale settings (just read the lyrics for <em>Bittersweet Genesis for Him AND Her</em>), while the instrumentals transport you to a foreign pixie wonderland. </p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>Lanterns</h3>
					<p><em>Son Lux</em></p>
					<p>This is probably my favorite album as a whole. All the tracks stand solidly on their own while working together to paint the same larger picture. The last track, <em>Lanterns Lit</em>, is hauntingly beautiful and even better live!</p>
					</div>
				</div>

					<h3>White Lighter</h3>
					<p><em>Typhoon</em></p>
					<p>Admittedly, this isn't something you just put on and get on with the rest of your day, unless you're okay with getting dirty looks from singing along. The lyrics can be a little strange, e.g. <em>One Hundred Years</em> talks about waking up 100 years later to find that your limbs have been cut off.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>Heza</h3>
					<p><em>Generationals</em></p>
					<p>These guys make really good pop. It's fun music! Even as a self-proclaimed fun-hater, I can't hate this. It almost makes me want to dance, and that is probably as close to dancing as I'll ever get. They do have a newer album out, called <em>Alix</em>, but it hasn't grown on me yet.</p>

					<h3>The Royal Tenenbaums</h3>
					<p>Admittedly, there is not a Wes Anderson movie that I do not like. I also have a huge soft spot for movies that deal extensively with family relations, so it's nearly impossible that I wouldn't like this.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>Ghost in the Shell</h3>
					<p>Like <em>Akira</em>, this is an anime you don't get judged for liking because it was made in the 90s and that somehow makes it (and you by extension) cool. The animation is fantastic and Motoko is perhaps one of the most badass female characters ever.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>The Usual Suspects</h3>
					<p>I should've watched this much sooner, before I spoiled it for myself (thanks, Key and Peele). Even though I had a pretty good idea of how it would end, it was still thoroughly enjoyable. The cast is stellar, and I acquired a newfound respect for Kevin Spacey after watching this.</p>

					<h3>All About Lily Chou&#8209;Chou</h3>
					<p>This was a little hard to watch, but my appreciation for it grew as time went on. The build-up is incredibly slow but rewarding, and the heavy atmosphere is maintained throughout. Fourteen-year-olds lead tough lives, really.</p> 
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="square-wrapper">
					<div class="square">
					<h3>Melancholia</h3>
					<p>Surprisingly, I liked the first half better, which focuses on the sister most people hated. Perhaps I'm a bad judge of character. This movie is about two sisters who are a little off in the head, albeit in completely different ways.</p>
